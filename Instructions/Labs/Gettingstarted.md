# Get started with Real-Time Analytics and Data Science with Microsoft Fabric

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Scenario

At Contoso, the data analytics team is implementing a modern data solution to process real-time sensor data and generate actionable business insights. This lab provides hands-on experience with Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Analytics and Data capabilities, including KQL queries, Power BI reporting and workflows. By completing this lab, you will learn how to analyze streaming data and leverage Microsoft Fabric to create scalable analytics solutions that support informed decision making across the organization.

## Overview

In this lab, we will use Microsoft Fabric to perform real-time data analytics and data science. Fabric provides an end-to-end platform for data solutions, including Synapse Real-Time Analytics, which leverages a KQL Database and Kusto Query Language (KQL) to analyze structured and unstructured data efficiently. Real-time analytics enables organizations to process log files, streaming data, and time-series information at scale. Additionally, data science techniques, including machine learning with scikit-learn in Python, help identify complex patterns and train AI models. This integration empowers organizations to extract meaningful insights and democratize data access for informed decision-making.

## Objective

- **Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric:** Learn how to use Real-Time Analytics in Microsoft Fabric, focusing on Synapse Real-Time Analytics with Kusto Query Language (KQL) for data analysis. By the end of this session, you will know how to analyze real-time data using KQL and add KQL queries to Power BI reports to get useful insights easily.
- **Data science in Microsoft Fabric:** Learn the basics of data science in Microsoft Fabric, covering important concepts and real-world uses. By the end of this session, you will be able to analyze data, create AI models, and manage machine learning workflows effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of cloud computing and data analytics concepts.  
- Familiarity with Microsoft Azure services.  
- A Microsoft Fabric-enabled workspace with necessary permissions.  
- Access to Microsoft Fabric services such as OneLake, Data Engineering, and Data Science experiences.  
- Familiarity with Power BI reports.

## Architecture

These labs follow a structured, step-by-step workflow to streamline data processing and machine learning operations. The process begins with authentication and access management, ensuring secure entry into the environment. Next, a workspace is established, where users interact with datasets, perform queries using KQL, and generate insightful reports. Data is then uploaded into the system, stored efficiently, and prepared for further processing. Once the data is available, it is loaded into notebooks for analysis, followed by the training of machine learning models to extract meaningful insights. To enhance the experimentation process, MLflow is utilized to track and manage various model iterations, ensuring optimal performance. Finally, the trained models and notebooks are systematically saved, and the computational session is terminated to optimize resource utilization. This structured approach ensures a seamless transition from data ingestion to model training and experiment tracking while maintaining efficiency and reproducibility throughout the process.
