### Estimated Duration: 120 Minutes

## Scenario

At Contoso, the data analytics team is building a modern data platform to analyze real-time business data and generate valuable insights. The team needs to process large volumes of structured and time series data efficiently to support faster decision making. In this lab, you will explore Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Analytics capabilities by creating a workspace, working with databases, analyzing data using Kusto Query Language (KQL), and creating Power BI reports. By completing this lab, you will understand how Microsoft Fabric enables organizations to perform real-time data analysis and transform data into actionable insights.

## Overview

Microsoft Fabric provides an end-to-end platform for data solutions, including real-time data analytics. Synapse Real-Time Analytics in Fabric uses a KQL Database to provide table storage and Kusto Query Language (KQL), which is a powerful tool for analyzing data. This structure provides an efficient way to find insights and patterns from textual or structured data. Moreover, KQL is optimized for data that includes a time series component, such as real-time data from log files or streaming services. With Real-Time Analytics, you can focus and scale up your analytics solution while democratizing data for the needs of your entire data organization.

    ![](./Images/E1T3S5-3.png)

1. Then use the wizard to import the data into a new table by selecting the following options: 

    - **Select or create a destination table:**
        - **Database:** *The database you created is already selected*
        - **Table:** *Create a new table named* **sales (1)** by clicking on the **+** **sign** to the left of ***New table***, then click on **checkmark button (2)**.

          ![New table wizard step one](./Images/E1T3S7-1.png)

        - You will now see the **Drag files here or Browse for files** hyperlink appear in the same window.

          ![New table wizard step two](./Images/E1T3S7-2.png)

        - Browse or drag your **sales.csv (1)** onto the screen from **C:\LabFiles\dp-data-main** and wait for the Status box to change to a green check box, and then select **Next (2)**.

          ![New table wizard step three](./Images/L1T2S8.3-2611.png)

        - In the screen below, you'll notice that the column headings are in the first row. Although the system has detected them, we still need to move the **First row is column header (1)** slider above these lines to prevent any errors. Once you adjust the slider, everything should appear correctly. Finally, click the **Finish (2)** button in the bottom right corner of the panel to proceed.

          ![New table wizard step five](./Images/E1T3S7-4.png)

        - Wait for the steps in the summary screen to complete, which include **(1):**
            - Create table (sales)
            - Create mapping (sales_mapping)
            - Data queuing
            
        - Select the **Close (2)** button

          ![New table wizard step six](./Images/E1T3S7-5.png)

            > **Note:** In this task, you imported a very small amount of static data from a file, which is fine for the purposes of this task. In reality, you can use Kusto to analyze much larger volumes of data, including real-time data from a streaming source such as Azure Event Hubs.

## Task 3: Use KQL to query the sales table

1. Run the query. Then review the results, which should contain only the rows for sales orders for the *Road-250 Black, 48* product.

1. Modify the query as follows:

    ```kusto
   sales
   | where Item == 'Road-250 Black, 48'
   | where datetime_part('year', OrderDate) > 2020
    ```
    ![](./Images/fab-image9.png)

1. Run the query and review the results, which should contain only sales orders for *Road-250 Black, 48* made after 2020.

1. Modify the query as follows:

    ```kusto
   sales
   | where OrderDate between (datetime(2020-01-01 00:00:00) .. datetime(2020-12-31 23:59:59))
   | summarize TotalNetRevenue = sum(UnitPrice) by Item
   | sort by Item asc
    ```

    ![](./Images/fab-image10.png)

1. Run the query and review the results, which should contain the total net revenue for each product between January 1st and December 31st 2020, in ascending order of product name.

1. Navigate to **dp_fabric-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** workspace from the hub menu bar on the left. Select **Eventhouse-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** KQL Database from the list.
